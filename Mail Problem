Hello,
Many of wordpress users find difficult to send e-mails to users by using server mail id. Like for regstraion verfication link, 
welocme email etc. By default wordpress php mailer all mail goes to spams. 
So how to setup the mail configuration in wordpress.

Step 1 -> Create a server mail id on your hosting like godaddy, bluehost. 
1.a -> After creating the id, go to mail configuration (settings) in your cpanel , there you will see outgoing mail configuration 
SMTP settings.
1.b -> Copy the Outgoing server name host, port, username and password in atext file.

Step 2 -> Go to wordpress admin dashboard. Go to add new plugins and install wp mail SMTP 
link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/

Step 3 -> After activating the plugin, go to admin, settings you will see email. 
Click on that then fill the following details there:

From email: Server mail id
From name: as you wish
Mailer: Select Send all mail via SMTP
Fill the SMTP details host, port, in encryption select SSL, Authentiction yes, and in username and password fill server mail id and 
its password.
Save the settings.

Step 4-> AFter that you can test the mail fnction by filling any email id and you will recieve the mail in inbox.
